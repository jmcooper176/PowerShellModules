# This script searches the Events (Audit log) for events of Category Queued and looks into the RelatedDocumentIds field for further refining.
# This script will return the name of a user who started a deployment (queued), but you need to enter one or more of the following.
#
# Properties of the RelatedDocumentIds for DeploymentQueued.
# Projects-342, Releases-965, Environments-1, ServerTasks-159414, Channels-362, ProjectGroups-1
#
# The easiest way to find a single result is by using the ServerTasks-ID in my example below. (Searching time can vary based on amount of events)
